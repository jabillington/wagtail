An updated sequence viewer/editor for genome engineering 

Based on conversations with other users, and my own experience several features that are missing currently from sequence editor or that could 
be improved.
- Easier multiplex in-silico cloning. Benchling, SnapGen, APE etc. lack useful tools for doing so.
- Richer version control for plasmids. Git tree's with branches and a visual edit history 
- Improved tools for Genome engineering. Displaying region of interest with tracks for epigentic data, polII occupancy etc for identifying hotspots, 
automatic homology arm creation for knock-ins.
